Once there was a squirrel named Alex that climbed up a  tree in the middle of the Muir Wood Forest. Alex wanted to go on an adventure.

He got hungry when he saw an Acorn.  

The squirrel ate the Acorn.

The squirrel then climbed down the tree.

The squirrel saw another squirrel named Elvin and learned how to play the flute.
